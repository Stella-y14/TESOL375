        <div class="intro-block">
            <p>
                This profile is not just a collection of observations, but a declaration of the practices 
                I am committed to implementing in my own classroom. It defines who I am as a teacher today.

            <h2>1. Participatory Learning</h2>
            <p class="key-question"><strong>Key Question:</strong> How do you facilitate language learning through active student engagement?</p>

                <div class="insight-item">
                    <h3>The Learner as a Doer</h3>
                    <p>I believe in moving beyond passive listening to active engagement. My observations have confirmed that the most effective learning occurs when students shift from listeners to active participants.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="insight-item">
                    <h3>Peer Interaction</h3>
                    <p>Collaboration is key. I implement pair and group work to allow students to negotiate meaning, provide peer feedback, and deepen their understanding of concepts like topic sentences.</p>

                <div class="list-item">
                    <h3>Scaffolding with Meta-Language</h3>
                    <p>I use relatable metaphors, such as the <strong>"Hamburger Structure"</strong> (Topic, Support, Conclusion), to provide a clear mental model for complex writing tasks. Explicit phrases like "Use the language of the prompt" serve as hooks for memory.</p>

                <div class="list-item">
                    <h3>Attending Behaviors</h3>
                    <p>Non-verbal communication—eye contact, nodding, and gestures—signals to students that they are "seen." This reduces anxiety and creates a safe space for input to be received and processed.</p>

                    <h3>Continuous Monitoring</h3>
                    <p>Assessment isn't just a final exam. I allocate approximately <strong>8 minutes per class</strong> for check-ins like "Okay?" or "Questions?" to catch misunderstandings early.</p>

                <div class="insight-item">
                    <h3>Culture of Error</h3>
                    <p>I strive to correct gently (e.g., blaming the font size, not the student) to maintain confidence. In my classroom, errors are welcomed as necessary steps in learning.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="insight-item">
                    <h3>Feedback Priority</h3>

                    <h3>Fostering Autonomy</h3>
                    <p>Motivation thrives on relevance. By allowing students to choose their own sources and arguments, I shift the ownership of learning from the teacher to the student.</p>
